# Sonoff TH ESP32 Demo repo

This repo demonstrates how to use the basic GPIO functionality of a Sonoff TH Origin based on the ESP32-D0WD-V3.

Here is an overview which features are supported / reverse engineered:

| Feature            | TH Origin | POW Origin | POW Elite |
|--------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 3x LED             | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   |
| Relay              | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark:    | :heavy_check_mark:   |
| Temperature sensor | :heavy_check_mark:   | n.a.       | :heavy_check_mark:   |
| Power-Meter        | n.a.      | ?          | ?         |
| Display            | n.a.      | n.a.       | ?         |
|                    |           |            |           |

*Note: As you might guess, I only had a TH Origin at my disposal*

## TODOs:

- Check Power-Meter support for POW Origin
- Check Display-Support for POW Elite
